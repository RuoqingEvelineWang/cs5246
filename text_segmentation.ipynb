      "Throughout history we have used concepts from our current technology as\n",
      "metaphors to describe our world. Examples of this are the description of the\n",
      "body as a factory during the Industrial Age, and the description of the brain as a\n",
      "computer during the Information Age. These metaphors are useful because they\n",
      "extend the knowledge acquired by the scientiﬁc and technological developments\n",
      "to other areas, illuminating them from a novel perspective. For example, it is\n",
      "common to extend the particle metaphor used in physics to other domains, such\n",

      "plicated behaviour, for the purposes of crowd dynamics they can be eﬀectively\n",
      "described as particles, with the beneﬁt that there is an established mathemati-\n",
      "cal framework suitable for this description. Another example can be seen with\n",
      "cybernetics [4, 28], where the system metaphor is used: everything is seen as a\n",
      "system with inputs, outputs, and a control that regulates the internal variables\n",
      "of the system under the inﬂuence of perturbations from its environment. Yet\n",
      "another example can be seen with the computational metaphor [60], where the\n",
      "universe can be modelled with simple discrete computational machines, such as\n",
      "cellular automata or Turing machines.\n",
      "Having in mind that we are using metaphors, this paper proposes to extend\n",
      "the concept of information to describe the world: from elementary particles to\n",
      "galaxies, with everything in between, particularly life and cognition. There is no\n",

      "in physical systems, but—as Roederer puts it—information is passive in physics\n",
      "and active in biology [49]. However, it becomes complicated to describe how this\n",
      "information came to be in terms of the physical laws of matter and energy. In\n",
      "this paper the inverse approach is proposed: let us describe matter and energy in\n",
      "terms of information. If atoms, molecules and cells are described as information,\n",
      "there is no need of a qualitative shift (from non-living to living matter) while\n",
      "describing the origin and evolution of life: this is translated into a quantitative\n",
      "\n",
      "shift (from less complex to more complex information).\n",
      "There is a similar problem when we study the origin and evolution of cog-\n",
      "nition [20]: it is not easy to describe cognitive systems in terms of matter and\n",
      "energy. The drawback with the physics-based approach to the studies of life and\n",
      "cognition is that it requires a new category, that in the best situations can be\n",

      "not explanatory. Moreover, it stealthily introduces a dualist view of the world:\n",
      "if we cannot relate properly matter and energy with life and cognition, we are\n",
      "forced to see these as separate categories. Once this breach is made, there is\n",

      "Another beneﬁt of using information as a basic descriptor for our world is\n",
      "that the concept is well studied and formal methods have already been developed\n",
      "[14, 46], as well as its philosophical implications have been discussed [19]. Thus,\n",
      "there is no need to develop a new formalism, since information theory is well\n",

      "Notion 1 Information is anything that an agent can sense, perceive, or observe.\n",
      "This notion is in accordance with Shannon’s [52], where information is seen\n",
      "as a just-so arrangement, a deﬁned structure, as opposed to randomness [12, 13],\n",
      "and it can be measured in bits. This notion can be applied to everything that\n",
      "surrounds us, including matter and energy, since we can perceive it—because it\n",
      "has a deﬁned structure—and we are agents, according to the following notion:\n",
      "Notion 2 An agent is a description of an entity that acts on its environment\n",
      "[22, p. 39].\n",
      "\n",
      "Noticing that agents (and their environments) are also information (as they\n",

      "from the meaning that an agent gives to it. Meaning is an active product of the\n",
